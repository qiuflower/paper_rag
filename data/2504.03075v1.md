**ABSTRACT**
#### Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars are strongly magnetic upper main-sequence stars that exhibit light rotational variability due to an uneven surface distribution of certain peculiar elements, which may appear in phase at certain wavelengths and in antiphase to the flux at other wavelengths. We present a study of the properties of photometric variability of a sample of confirmed mCP stars (mostly Ap/CP2 stars), mCP star candidates, and several non-CP stars in the near ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions based on observational data from the GALEX and Kepler prime missions. Antiphase variations between the near ultraviolet and optical light curves are observed in the majority of mCP stars. We investigate the presence of a correlation of the variability amplitudes in both wavelength regions with effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity and calculate model atmospheres, spectral energy distributions and synthetic light curves to connect our findings to theoretical models. While the theoretical calculations show that, at fixed abundances, a clear correlation between the light curve amplitude ratios and effective temperature is expected, our sample does not show any correlation with the investigated properties. This may be due to the highly individualistic abundance patterns of our sample stars, which are the main contributors to the line blanketing in different wavelength bands. Key words: stars: chemically peculiar ‚Äì stars: starspots ‚Äì stars: atmospheres ‚Äì stars: abundances


**1 INTRODUCTION**

Ap/CP2 stars are upper main-sequence objects characterised by peculiar atmospheric abundances of elements such as Si, Fe, Sr, Cr,
Eu, and the rare-earth elements as compared to the solar composition (e.g. Preston 1974; Renson & Manfroid 2009; Ghazaryan et al.
2018). They exhibit strong, stable, and globally organised magnetic
fields with strengths of up to several tens of kilogauss (Babcock
1947; Landstreet 1982; Auri√®re et al. 2007) and show a non-uniform
surface distribution of elements, which is associated with the characteristics of the magnetic field and results in the formation of spots of
enhanced or depleted element abundance. In these ‚Äòchemical spots‚Äô,
flux is redistributed through line and continuum blanketing (e.g.
Wolff & Wolff 1971; Lanz et al. 1996; Shulyak et al. 2010; Krtiƒçka
et al. 2013). As a consequence of the magnetic field being inclined
to the rotation axis (Stibbs 1950), most CP2 stars exhibit light, spectral, and magnetic field strength variations over the rotation period.

Photometrically variable CP2 stars are conventionally referred to as
*ùõº* [2] Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables (Samus et al. 2017).

The He-rich and the He-weak/CP4 stars (e.g. Preston 1974; Renson
& Manfroid 2009; Ghazaryan et al. 2019) are in many respects the
hotter analogues of the CP2 stars. Except for one subgroup (the
He-weak PGa stars), they also possess strong and stable magnetic
fields and present an inhomogeneous chemical surface composition,
which leads to the same kind of variability as observed in the CP2
stars. Together with the CP2 stars, the He-peculiar stars are generally
referred to by convention as magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP)

stars.

The observed amplitude and shape of the light curves of ACV
variables depend on the investigated wavelength regions. The light
variations may appear in phase in different photometric passbands
or vary in antiphase to the flux at other wavelengths (e.g. Manfroid
& Mathys 1986; Shulyak et al. 2010). A limited number of ACV
stars have been studied at space-ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Antiphase variations of the flux between the far-UV and the optical
wavelength regions is a common property, as it has been found in
CU Vir (Sokolov 2000; Krtiƒçka et al. 2019), *ùõº* [2] CVn (Molnar 1973;

Sokolov 2011), a Cen (Sokolov 2012), *ùúÑ* Cas (Molnar et al. 1976),
HD 215441 (Leckrone 1974), *ùúô* Dra (Jamar 1977; Prv√°k et al. 2015),
*ùúÉ* Aur (Krtiƒçka et al. 2015), and *ùúñ* UMa (Molnar 1975). It is due
to a global flux redistribution to longer wavelengths, caused by the
phase-dependent absorption. However, the pattern of this redistribution can be different from star to star. The wavelength interval
where the flux remains almost unchanged over the rotational cycle
is called the ‚Äònull-wavelength region‚Äô (Molnar 1975) and may be
located at different wavelengths. Therefore, the antiphase variations
may not only occur between the far-UV and optical wavelengths. In
particular, the near-UV interval shows non-unique behaviour: its flux
varies in phase with the visible in CU Vir (Sokolov 2000; Krtiƒçka
et al. 2019), a Cen (Sokolov 2012; Krtiƒçka et al. 2020), *ùúô* Dra (Jamar
1977; Prv√°k et al. 2015), and *ùúÉ* Aur (Krtiƒçka et al. 2015), while it
shows antiphase variation in *ùõº* [2] CVn (Molnar 1973; Sokolov 2011)
and *ùúÑ* Cas (Molnar et al. 1976). In the case of HD 215441, Leckrone
(1974) finds a null wavelength at ‚àº2460 √Ö, but does not present other
NUV intervals, while *ùúñ* UMa has not been studied in the space NUV
interval.

Antiphase variations may sometimes also be observed in the optical region, where, in general, the light changes are in phase in
the different photometric passbands. For example, antiphase variation of the *ùêµ* and *ùëâ* light curves of the CP2 star HD 240121 have
been reported by Gr√∂bel et al. (2017). Faltov√° et al. (2021) reported
antiphase variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al.
2019; Masci et al. 2019) *ùëî* and *ùëü* filters and employed this unique
characteristic for the search for new CP2 star candidates. In general,
ACV variables show an amazing diversity of light curve patterns,
whose characteristics depend on the surface distribution of spots and
the elements involved (Mikul√°≈°ek et al. 2007).
We here present a study of the properties of the photometric variability of a sample of mCP stars (mostly CP2 stars), mCP star candidates and several non-CP stars in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible
regions based on observational data of the space telescope GALEX
(Martin & GALEX Science Team 2003; Bianchi et al. 2017) and
the *Kepler* prime mission (Borucki et al. 2010). We investigate the
presence of a correlation of the variability amplitudes with stellar
parameters that affect the intensity of the absorption, in particular
effective temperature, and calculate synthetic light curves, model atmospheres, and spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles of diverse
chemical compositions to connect our findings to theoretical models.
Data sets are described in Sect. 2. The objects of our study, the
sample of mCP stars in the *Kepler* prime field, are discussed in
Sect. 3. Next, we illustrate the procedure used to determine the nearultraviolet (NUV) variability amplitude and its phase difference to
the light changes observed in the visible region (Sect. 4). Results are
presented in Sect. 5, notes on some individual objects in Sect. 6 and
final conclusions are exposed in Sect. 7.

**2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA BASES**

**2.1 The GALEX NUV observations**

The prime field of the *Kepler* mission (Borucki et al. 2010) has
rapidly become one of the most observed and studied stellar fields.
It is located in the northern hemisphere and is centred at R.A. =
19h22m40s and Dec =+44 [‚ó¶] 30 [‚Ä≤] 00 [‚Ä≤‚Ä≤] (J2000), not far from Vega. Its
more than 100 square degrees have been observed by the *GALEX*
space telescope during the Complete All-Sky UV Survey Extension
(CAUSE), as part of a programme funded by the Cornell University
(P.I. James Lloyd). The observations have been carried out with the

MNRAS **000**, 1‚Äì14 (2024)


NUV detector (Martin & GALEX Science Team 2003; Siegmund
et al. 2004) only (the FUV detector stopped working in May 2009),
during 47 days in August-September 2012, a period that coincides
with Quarter 14 of the *Kepler* observations.
More details on the *GALEX* CAUSE survey of the *Kepler* prime
field are provided by Olmedo et al. (2015). This article also
presents the *GALEX* -CAUSE *Kepler* (GCK) catalogue [1] of about
660,000 NUV point sources, down to a limiting magnitude of
NUV‚âÉ22.6 mag. Most GCK sources are included in the *Kepler* Input
Catalog (KIC; Brown et al. 2011).
Due to the modality used by *GALEX* in the observations of the
*Kepler* field (multiple scans along a larger circle), each GCK source
has been observed several times. The *GALEX* processing pipeline
divided the whole area into 180 tiles: each tile was visited 17 times,
on average, with a maximum of 22, for a total of 3,251 images.
Therefore, besides measuring the brightness of the sources on the
co-added images as it was done by Olmedo et al. (2015), it is also
possible to extract their light curves, by separately reducing each tile
and perform the photometry of all detected sources. This has already
been done by our group (Bertone et al. 2020) and the catalogue of all
NUV light curves of point sources in the *Kepler* field will be presented
in a future publication (Olmedo et al., in preparation). Data reduction
has followed the same procedure as in Olmedo et al. (2015), with
the only difference of using the background image of the *GALEX*
pipeline [2], rather than computing our own. However, in the NUV
band, the detector background is negligible and the sky background
level is very low: it amounts to a count rate of 10 [‚àí][3] cts sec [‚àí][1] arcsec [‚àí][2]

(Morrissey et al. 2007) [3] ; therefore, for a source of NUV=20 mag (AB
system) and FWHM=5 [‚Ä≤‚Ä≤], it would correspond to ‚àº 1% of the total
flux.

**2.2 The Kepler light curves**

The *Kepler* spacecraft used a differential photometer with a 115
square-degrees field of view and an aperture of 0.95 m (Borucki et al.
2010). The detectors consisted of 21 modules each equipped with
two 2200x1024 pixel CCDs. The *Kepler* telescope produced single
‚àº
passband light curves in the visible range ( 4200‚Äì9000 √Ö) with
two different integration times in the long-cadence (LC), 29.4 minsampling mode (Jenkins et al. 2010) and the short-cadence (SC),
‚àº1 min-sampling mode (Gilliland et al. 2010).
The prime *Kepler* mission‚Äôs main goal was the detection of transiting planets to determine the frequency of Earth-like planets in or
near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars (Borucki et al. 2008, 2010).
It was in operation for four years (2009 May 2 to 2013 May 8), until
the loss of a second reaction wheel on the spacecraft. After that,
*Kepler* entered a redefined mission called K2 (Howell et al. 2014)
that lasted another four years until the satellite‚Äôs official retirement in
October 2018.

*Kepler* produced long, quasi-uninterrupted and high-quality time
series data. To optimise solar panel efficiency, the spacecraft completed a 90 degree-roll every three months; therefore, *Kepler* data
are divided into four quarters each year. The final Data Release 25

includes 197,096 stars (Mathur et al. 2017), which were observed in
some or all Quarters 1-17.
*Kepler* has been very successful in its main goal and discovered
thousands of exoplanet candidates. It has also enabled stellar variability analyses with unprecedented detail. For more information on
the *Kepler* spacecraft, we refer to Borucki et al. (2010) and Koch
et al. (2010).

**3 SAMPLE SELECTION, CLASSIFICATION AND LIGHT**
**CURVE DATA**

We initially collected a sample of mCP stars and candidate mCP
stars in and near the *Kepler* prime field that was chosen from the
lists of H√ºmmerich et al. (2018) and Bauer-Fasching et al. (2024).
It was then supplemented with another set of mCP star candidates
identified by S. H√ºmmerich (private communication).
This initial number of more than 100 objects decreased by applying
the following selection criteria: (1) the stars must have been observed
by both *GALEX* and *Kepler* ; (2) the number of points in the *GALEX*
light curve must be greater than three; (3) the star must be fainter
than 14.7 mag in NUV (GCK catalogue).
We imposed the latter requisite as the photon counting *GALEX*
detector suffers from loss of linearity at high count rates (Morrissey
et al. 2007; see also Olmedo et al. 2015). This problem also affects the
repeatability of the measurements and thus it may create a spurious
variability. With respect to criterion (1), we comment that some of
the stars in the *Kepler* field observed by *GALEX* have no reliable
photometric data due to the presence of a nearby very bright object
or because of other instrumental artifacts.

Applying these criteria, we ended up with a final sample of 28
stars, of which 21 are present in the sample of H√ºmmerich et al.
(2018), who presented an investigation of the light variability of mCP
stars using *Kepler* data. These authors identified candidate mCP stars
via light-curve properties (in particular monoperiodic variability and
light-curve stability) and used newly acquired and archival spectra to
investigate these candidates.
The subsample of the 21 stars from H√ºmmerich et al. (2018)
which entered our sample consists of 14 spectroscopically confirmed
mCP stars (KIC 2853320, 3945892, 5739204, 5774743, 6715809,
6950556, 7628336, 8773445, 9541567, 10685175, 10905824,
10959320, 11154043, 11465134), three candidate mCP stars
(KIC 2969628, 3326428, 8362546), and four stars in which these
authors could not establish chemical peculiarities (non-CP stars;
KIC 5213466, 5727964, 8569986, 10082844). The non-CP stars
have been selected as ‚Äòcontrol sample‚Äô and to check the spectroscopic results with the here described method.
The stars KIC 4171302, 5000179, 8386865, 9665384, 10090722,
and 10096019 are from an unpublished list of mCP star candidates (H√ºmmerich, private communication). Two of these objects
(KIC 8386865 and KIC 10090722) were subsequently confirmed as
mCP stars by H√ºmmerich et al. (2020).
Finally, the star KIC 7976845 was identified as an mCP star on
the basis of its light variability properties (e.g. Faltov√° et al. 2021)
and a significantly positive Œî *ùëé* value calculated from Gaia BP/RP
low-resolution spectra (Paunzen et al. 2005; Carrasco et al. 2021;
Paunzen & Pri≈°egen 2022). It is part of a recently published sample
of mCP stars and candidates (Bauer-Fasching et al. 2024).
As described in the following section (Section 3.1), we use here
our own spectroscopic observations and, where available, spectra
from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) to investigate and confirm the mCP star candidates

### UV survey of mCP stars in Kepler field 3

KIC 2969628, 3326428, 4171302, 5000179, 9665384, and 10096019

as bona-fide CP2 stars.

In summary, the final sample of stars that was investigated with
GALEX UV and *Kepler* photometry in this study consists of 22
confirmed CP2 stars, one photometrically confirmed mCP star
(KIC 7976845), one mCP star candidate (KIC 8362546), and four
non-CP stars (KIC 5213466, 5727964, 8569986, 10082844).
Relevant parameters of our sample stars are reported in Table 1.
The first two columns contain the KIC and the GCK identifiers.

Columns three and four report another identifier from the SIMBAD
or VizieR databases (Wenger et al. 2000) and the stellar spectral type
(sources are identified in the table). Column five denotes the CP star
classification (CP2 = CP2 star; cand = candidate mCP star; nonCP
= non-CP star; photCP = mCP star identified by photometric criteria
alone). J2000 coordinates from Gaia DR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016; Babusiaux et al. 2022; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022) are
provided in the next two columns. The rotational periods presented
in column eight are based on literature values (as indicated in the
notes to the table) and are presented here rounded to five decimal
places. The last two columns contain the brightness in the *Kepler*
and *GALEX* NUV passbands.

**3.1 Spectral classification**

Spectral classification was performed using own spectroscopic observations and spectra from LAMOST.
We acquired observations of KIC 3326428 and KIC 2969628
in July and September 2023 at the 2.1-meter telescope of the Observatorio Astrofƒ±ƒ±sico Guillermo Haro, located in Sonora, Mexico,
with a B√∂ller & Chivens spectrograph, equipped with an e2v 4240 2040√ó2040 px CCD. The instrument setup consisted of a 600
line mm [‚àí][1] grating, at a blaze angle of 8.3 [‚ó¶], and a 200 *ùúá* m wide slit;
this configuration provided a wavelength coverage between about
3870 and 4800 √Ö, with a spectral resolution of 3 √Ö for KIC 3326428
and 2.3 √Ö for KIC 2969628, due to an improved focusing of the spectrograph. Multiple images of each spectra were co-added to reach
a signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 for KIC 3326428 (observed during cloudy weather), and about 30 for KIC 2969628. The spectra
were reduced using IRAF (Tody 1986, 1993), following the standard
procedure for spectroscopic data: bias subtraction, flat-field correction, cosmic-ray removal, wavelength calibration (through an internal
HeAr lamp) and flux calibration, using standard stars from the European Southern Observatory list (Hamuy et al. 1992).
The LAMOST survey (Zhao et al. 2012; Cui et al. 2012) employs
a reflecting Schmidt telescope located at the Xinglong Observatory
in Beƒ≥ing, China, with an effective aperture of 3.6‚àí4.9 m and a field
of view of 5 [‚ó¶] . LAMOST can take up to 4000 spectra in a single
exposure (resolving power R‚àº1800; limiting magnitude r ‚àº 19 mag;
wavelength coverage 3700 √Ö to 9000 √Ö) and is therefore particularly
suited for large-scale spectral surveys. Data products are released to
the public in consecutive data releases and can be accessed via the
LAMOST spectral archive. [4] The present study used spectra released
in LAMOST DR4 (Luo et al. 2018).
Spectral classification was performed in the framework of the refined MK classification system following the methodology outlined
in Gray & Garrison (1987, 1989a,b), Garrison & Gray (1994) and
Gray & Corbally (2009). For a precise classification and to iden
‚àí
tify peculiarities, the blue-violet (3800 4600 √Ö) spectral region was
compared visually to, and overlaid with, MK standard star spectra,

mCP stars exhibit several peculiarities that need to be taken into
account during the process of classification. They often show weak or
otherwise peculiar Ca ii K line profiles, weak Mg ii 4481 √Ö lines and
are markedly deficient in He (Gray & Corbally 2009; Ghazaryan et al.
2018). In addition, mCP stars generally show enhanced and peculiar
metallic lines. Therefore, the hydrogen-line profiles are generally the
most accurate indicators of the actual temperature of these objects
(Gray & Corbally 2009). Where appropriate, spectral types based on
the Ca ii K line strength (the k-line type) and the hydrogen-line profile
(the h-line type) (Osawa 1965) were determined. As the metallic
lines of most mCP stars are so peculiar that they cannot be used for
luminosity classification, luminosity types were based on the wings
of the hydrogen lines (Gray & Corbally 2009).
In this way, KIC 2969628 and 3326428 were confirmed as CP2
stars with own spectroscopic observations, while KIC 4171302,
5000179, 9665384, and 10096019 were confirmed as CP2 stars on
the basis of LAMOST spectra. Figure 1 provides an example of this
process. The final spectral types are included in Table 1.

**3.2 Light curves and phase diagrams in the NUV and the visible**

We searched and downloaded the *Kepler* light curves of our sample
stars from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) [6] .
As the *GALEX* -CAUSE observations of the *Kepler* prime field have
been carried out from 2012 August 3 to September 20, we extracted
the *Kepler* data from the simultaneously acquired Quarter 14. We

transformed the *Kepler* time system, expressed in barycentric Julian
Date, which is used to correct for the motion of the spacecraft with
respect to the center of mass of the Solar system, to the *GALEX*
system, expressed in Julian Date (JD); we used the formula from
Thompson et al. (2016, p. 17). We also defined the time *ùë°* =0 d, which
corresponds to JD=2456143.0, and selected the *Kepler* data points
acquired in the time interval 0 ‚©Ω *ùë°* ‚©Ω 47 d because the *GALEX* data
cover the interval 0 *.* 8 ‚â≤ *ùë°* ‚â≤ 46 *.* 5. Two stars have not been observed
by *Kepler* in Quarter 14: for KIC 4171302, we therefore extracted
data from Quarter 13, while for KIC 9665384, we selected data from

‚àº
Quarter 9 ( 1.2 yr before). To produce the working light curve for
each object, we first transformed the PDCSAP flux to magnitudes (see
Thompson et al. 2016) and we then subtracted the average magnitude,
since we are only interested in analyzing the variability of the sources.
Each light curve typically has about 2230 data points.
All *GALEX* light curves of our sample stars can be considered of
good quality since all points have a signal-to-noise ratio SNR *>* 10.
Furthermore, we visually inspected a suitable region of the *GALEX*
images of each visit to each star, in order to check whether the
photometric measurements were affected by instrumental artifacts
(Olmedo et al. 2015; Bianchi et al. 2017) [7] . This analysis did not
show any anomalies. For these light curves to be comparable with
the *Kepler* ones, we subtracted the average NUV magnitude. These
light curves have between 11 and 22 data points, with a median of
18 points.

with two standard star spectra taken from the *libr18_225* collection. Some prominent lines and blends relevant to the classification of CP2 stars are identified.
We note the peculiarly strong Cr ii, Sr ii, and Eu ii features and the weak and unusually broad Ca ii K line in the CP2 star.


We then folded the data of the light curves into phase diagrams
by assigning phase *ùúô* =0 to time *ùë°* =0 d for all objects, assuming (as
has been well studied) that the variability periods coincide with
the rotation periods (see Table 1). This implies that *ùúô* =0 does not
necessarily coincide with a specific feature of the light curve, such
as the maximum or minimum of the brightness.
Some *Kepler* phase curves show outliers or instrumental drifts or a
non-negligible dispersion in the brightness at the same phase. For the
later analysis, we therefore had to produce an average curve. Hence,
we first proceeded with an iterative 3 *ùúé* clipping and then computed
an average value by smoothing the data with a moving boxcar of 50
points. As examples, in Fig. 2, we show several light curves and the
corresponding phase diagrams.

**4 ASSESSING THE NUV AMPLITUDE AND PHASE**

**DIFFERENCE**

The number of the NUV points in the phase curves is too small for
directly assessing the variability properties, such as the period and the
amplitude. Therefore, we made the assumption that the *GALEX* NUV
light curve has the same period and shape as the visible one, which
has been shown to hold true for most ACV variables (e.g. Molnar
1973, 1975, cf. also Section 1), and used two different methods to
determine the amplitude of the NUV variation and the phase shift
between the NUV and the visible curves. The first method makes use

of an Asexual Genetic Algorithm (AGA; Cant√≥ et al. 2009), while
in the second we fit the phase curves with harmonic polynomials,
following the model of Mikul√°≈°ek et al. (2007).

**4.1 The asexual genetic algorithm**

For implementing the AGA, we described the NUV phase curve of a
mCP star with the model:

Œî *ùëö* NUV model ( *ùúô* ) = *ùõº* Œî *ùëö* Kep ( *ùúô* + *ùúè* ) + *ùõΩ,* (1)


where Œî *ùëö* Kep is the *Kepler* average phase curve, Œî *ùëö* NUV model is the
*GALEX* phase curve, while the three free parameters are: *ùõº*, the
amplitude ratio of the NUV curve to the visible one; *ùúè*, the phase
difference (in the interval 0‚Äì1); and *ùõΩ*, the offset between the mean
of two curves.

The AGA will find the best *ùõº, ùúè, ùõΩ* values by minimizing the reduced chi-square, defined as:


where Œî *ùëö* NUV obs *,ùëñ* is the value of the *ùëñ* -th point of the *GALEX* observed data, with error *ùúé* NUV [2] obs *,ùëñ* [,][ Œî] *[ùëö]* [NUV] [model] *[,ùëñ]* [is the value of the]
*ùëñ* -th point of the computed model of the *GALEX* phase curve, at the
same *ùúô* as the observed point, and *ùëõ* is the total number of points.
As a first step, for each free parameter ( *ùõº, ùúè, ùõΩ* ), an initial random
population of *ùëÅ* 0 =3050 values (i.e. individuals) is generated in a
defined interval and the model for the NUV phase curve (Equation 1)
is computed. Then, the fitness of each individual is evaluated by
means of a merit function, which in this case is the *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] (Equation 2).
The *ùëÅ* 1 =50 individuals with the highest fitness (i.e., smaller *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] ) are
selected and passed to the next generation (this is the reason of the
word "asexual" in the algorithm name). Then, for each free parameter,
a new and smaller interval is defined, centered at the parameter value
of each *ùëÅ* 1 selected individual, where a new generation of *ùëÅ* 2 =60
random individuals is created. Again, the fitness of all *ùëÅ* 1 √ó *ùëÅ* 2 + *ùëÅ* 1 (=
*ùëÅ* 0 ) individuals in this new generation is calculated and the process
is iterated until a stopping criterion is achieved. Here, this criterion
is that, for five successive generations, the *ùëÅ* 1 individuals do not
change and the difference between the minimum and maximum of
their *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] is less than 10 [‚àí][3] . Finally, the model (i.e., *ùõº, ùúè* and *ùõΩ* ) that
has the minimum *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] is assumed as the best solution and adopted as
the NUV model of the phase curve of the star. Cant√≥ et al. (2009)
thoroughly described the algorithm and its performance.
We evaluated the error associated to the free parameters *ùõº, ùúè* and
*ùõΩ* following the recipe of Avni (1976). Using the *ùúí* [2] values of indi

**Figure 3.** The *ùúí* [2] map of all combinations of *ùõº, ùúè, ùõΩ*, projected on two planes, of the CP2 stars KIC 3326428 (left panel) and KIC 8386865 (middle panel), and
the mCP star candidate KIC 8362546 (right panel). The black dot marks the location of the best solution. The colour scale (orange to violet) indicates the *ùúí* [2] in
standard deviation intervals (1 to 5 *ùúé* ), while the white colour covers the space where the *ùúí* [2] is more than 5 *ùúé* larger than the minimum or where there are no
data (i.e., no parameter combinations have been computed). As expected, the results for the CP2 stars indicate antiphase variability in the UV and *Kepler* light
curves. This is not the case for the mCP star candidate, which provides evidence that this star is not a mCP star after all.


viduals from all AGA iterations, we identified the volume, in the 3D
parameter space, where the *ùúí* [2] is lower than the MIN( *ùúí* [2] ) + 3 *.* 52674
(for 1 *ùúé* confidence level and 3 free parameters). The extreme values
of the volume in each dimension provide the error on each parameter. In order to further improve the error estimation, we added the
*ùúí* [2] from an extra set of random *ùõº, ùúè*, *ùõΩ* combinations, more homogeneously distributed in the parameters space, which increased the
total number of individuals to more than 1 million, on average. This
procedure produces asymmetric statistical errors around the mean.

Figure 3 illustrates, as an example, the *ùúí* [2] maps of the three stars
shown in Fig. 2. For the CP2 star KIC 3326428 (left panel), the parameters are well determined and constrained. The phase difference
*ùúè* is almost 1 and the amplitude ratio is negative: this implies that
the NUV and the visible curves are almost perfectly anticorrelated,
which basically confirms the star as a CP2 star. (In fact, during the

MNRAS **000**, 1‚Äì14 (2024)


course of our study, we were able to confirm this candidate mCP star
from H√ºmmerich et al. (2018) as a CP2 star by our own spectroscopic
observations, cf. Section 3.) For the CP2 star KIC 8386865, the presence of two maxima of similar amplitude during a rotational cycle is
reflected in the presence of various relative minima also in the map,
almost equidistant along *ùúè* and with a similar value of | *ùõº* |. Again, this
implies that the NUV and the visible curves are anticorrelated, in
expectations for this spectroscopically confirmed CP2 star. The latter
is the most common result provided by AGA; in these cases, we only
took into account the relative minimum where the best solution is

located to estimate the errors on the parameters. Finally, in the case
of the CP2 star candidate KIC 8362546, the AGA was not able to
find a solution for the phase shift *ùúè* nor to significantly constrain the
amplitude ratio *ùõº*, which can be viewed as evidence that the star is
not a CP2 star (cf. the discussion in Section 6.1).


-----

**4.2 The fit with harmonic polynomials**

Mikul√°≈°ek et al. (2007) stated that the light curves of mCP stars
can be well described by real-valued harmonic polynomials of 2nd
degree. We adapted their definition for the case of the *Kepler* phase

curves:

Œî *ùëö* Kep model ( *ùúô* ) = Œî *ùëö* Kep + *ùëê* 1 cos(2 *ùúãùúô* ) + *ùëê* 2 sin(2 *ùúãùúô* )

+ *ùëê* 3 cos(4 *ùúãùúô* ) + *ùëê* 4 sin(4 *ùúãùúô* ) *.* (3)

The free parameters in this equation are five: the four coefficients
*ùëê* *ùëñ* and the average Œî *ùëö* Kep . We fitted the *Kepler* observations of all
stars of the sample, using a robust least-squares minimization that
makes use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We found that
the best fits reproduce very well the shapes of the *Kepler* phase
curves, even though the *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] is, in many cases, quite large, because
the *Kepler* observational errors are extremely small (the SNR ranges
in the ‚àº2000-20,000 interval).
Then, in order to reproduce a similar procedure that we used with
the AGA fitting, we assumed the NUV phase curve to have the same
shape as the *Kepler* curve. So, we defined the function:

Œî *ùëö* NUV model ( *ùúô* ) = *ùõº* hf Œî *ùëö* Kep model ( *ùúô* + *ùúè* hf ) + *ùõΩ* hf (4)

where the three free parameters *ùõº* hf *, ùúè* hf *, ùõΩ* hf have the same meaning
as in the AGA fit. We then fitted the NUV observations, using the
same least-squares minimization algorithm as before, to find the best
fitting model of equation 4. As the number of free parameters is the
same as in the AGA fitting, the *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] values of the two methods are
directly comparable.

**5 THE RESULTS OF THE FITTING PROCEDURE**

**5.1 Results from the AGA**

We report the results provided by the AGA in Table 2: the columns
report the KIC ID number, the parameters ( *ùõº*, *ùõΩ*, *ùúè* ) of the best fit,
along with their respective positive and negative 1 *ùúé* errors, the *ùúí* *ùúà* [2]
of the best fit, the number of *GALEX* points, the amplitude ( *ùê¥* ) of
the *Kepler* light curve and the amplitude of the *GALEX* one, with its
positive and negative 1 *ùúé* errors (see Sect. 5.3 for the definition of the
amplitude), the classification of the *Kepler* light curve and, finally, the
Pearson‚Äôs linear correlation coefficient. These aspects are discussed
below. We summarise these results in Fig. 4, where we show the
distributions of the best solutions for the three free parameters.
The distribution of the absolute values of *ùõº* implies that the variability in the NUV is typically quite larger than in the visible: the
average is | *ùõº* | = 5 *.* 0 and only one star, KIC 9665384, has a slightly
lower amplitude in the NUV ( *ùõº* = ‚àí0 *.* 95 [+] ‚àí [2] 1 *[.]* *.* [75] 16 [), however it is one of]
the stars with the poorest fit (see below), as the error of the *GALEX*
observations is quite high with respect to the flux variation (cf. also
the corresponding phase plot in Fig. A1).
The *ùúè* distribution is characterised by a peak around a phase difference of 0 (at both *ùúè* = 0 or 1). This means that the NUV curve is
almost perfectly in phase (if *ùõº>* 0) or antiphase (if *ùõº<* 0) with the
visible one. Another broader peak is centred at about *ùúè* = 0 *.* 5, which
may also imply a strong positive or negative correlation, depending
on the shape of the light curve.
As expected, the distribution of the brightness offset *ùõΩ* is centered
around zero, but in many cases the value of *ùõΩ* is significant with
respect to the NUV amplitude. This shift is due to the much lower
number of data points in the *GALEX* light curves as compared to the
*Kepler* ones.

### UV survey of mCP stars in Kepler field 7

In Fig. 5, we present the plot of *ùõº* vs. *ùúè* . If the periodic variability
in the visible range is anticorrelated with that in NUV, as we should
expect for CP2 stars when the null wavelength is located somewhere
in between the two intervals, we would expect the points to be located in specific places in the plot. These locations also depend on
the distribution of the spots on the stellar surface that can produce
single-wave or double-wave light curves. Assuming that the curves,
at different wavelengths, have the same shape, a perfect anticorrelation is always obtained for *ùúè* = 0 or 1 and *ùõº<* 0. Then, in the case
of single-wave light curves, a strong anticorrelation is also present
when *ùúè* ‚àº 0 *.* 5 and *ùõº>* 0. Regarding the stars with double-wave
light curves, anticorrelation can also be achieved at *ùúè* ‚àº 0 *.* 5, but for
negative values of *ùõº* ; furthermore, also the combinations of *ùúè* ‚àº 0 *.* 25
and *ùúè* ‚àº 0 *.* 75, with positive *ùõº*, may indicate anticorrelation. These
regions are highlighted in Fig. 5. We have divided the sample in stars
with single-wave or double-wave light curves (see Table 2) and we
observe in the plot that most of the stars lie in or not far from the
correspondent regions of anticorrelation.
There are, however, some notable exceptions that we discuss also
with the help of Fig. 6, where we show the plot of the Pearson‚Äôs
linear coefficient *ùëü* that quantifies the correlation between the *GALEX*
observed points and the smoothed *Kepler* light curve (at the values
of *ùúè* of the NUV points).
First, there are three stars (the confirmed CP2 stars KIC 2853320
and 9665384 and the CP2 star candidate KIC 8362546) whose 1 *ùúé*
error covers the entire *ùúè* valid range. We can therefore consider
that the AGA left this parameter undetermined. These stars also
have very large errors on *ùõº* because the *GALEX* observational errors
are very large with respect to the maximum flux variation. Furthermore, they show a poor correlation between the NUV and visible
curves. Other four stars have *ùëü* ‚àº 0: the non-CP stars KIC 10082844

and KIC 5727964 and the confirmed CP2 stars KIC 8773445 and

KIC 1009601. For the three latter cases, the lack of correlation can be
explained by the large NUV observational errors with respect to the
amplitude of the flux variation and, in the case of KIC 5727964, also
for the small number of *GALEX* data (11). Regarding KIC 10082844,
the small | *ùëü* | is mainly caused by the large dispersion of the NUV flux
values in the interval 0 *< ùúô<* 0 *.* 3; this spread also produces a large
*ùúí* *ùúà* [2] of the AGA fit. Non-CP stars will be discussed in more detail in
Section 6.2.

We also recall the fact that while for the majority of mCP stars, the
null-wavelength region lies somewhere between the *GALEX* UV and
*Kepler* passbands (and hence these stars are expected to show the
corresponding anticorrelated light curve behaviour), for some mCP
stars, the null wavelength is situated in the optical region, for example
between the ZTF *ùëî* and *ùëü* filters (e.g. Faltov√° et al. 2021).
Finally, the non-CP star KIC 5213466 shows a strong positive
correlation between the *Kepler* and the *GALEX* NUV bands, with
the only caveat that it is one of the stars with the smallest number of *GALEX* observations. This finding corroborates the result of
H√ºmmerich et al. (2018) that this star is not an ACV variable.

All the other stars show a clear anticorrelation between the flux of

the *GALEX* NUV and *Kepler* wavelength intervals.

**5.2 Comparison with the results from the harmonic fitting**

The results of the harmonic fitting (HF) method are very similar to
those obtained with the AGA, as shown in Fig. 7. The only significant
difference is the value of *ùõº* of the candidate CP2 star KIC 8362546,
which changes from 15.1, in the AGA fit, to 6.6, with the HF; however,
this star is one of the three objects that have a value of *ùúè* completely
undetermined.
For some of the stars, some of the minimum *ùúí* *ùúà* [2] obtained with
the HF are slightly lower than the corresponding AGA values; this is
possibly because the shape of the *Kepler* curve, used as a reference,
is different in the two cases: for the AGA, it is a running average of
the data points, while for the HF, it is the harmonic curve of Eq. 3.
Considering the very high level of agreement between the two
fitting methods, in the rest of this work we only use the results from
the AGA, as the assumption of equal shape for the visible and NUV
light curves is more rigorous.

**5.3 Correlation of the light curve amplitudes with stellar**
**parameters**

Since the variability of CP2 stars is due to the different intensity of
the line blanketing, at different wavelength intervals and with the
phase of the rotation period, it is interesting to investigate if there is
a correlation of the variability amplitude with the stellar parameters
that affect the intensity of the absorption, in particular with effective

temperature.
With that goal in mind, we adopt the main atmospheric parameters
(the effective temperature *ùëá* eff and the surface gravity log *ùëî* ) derived
by using the calibrations of Paunzen (2024). These are based on
four commonly used references (Stassun et al. 2019; Anders et al.
2022; Fouesneau et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023) of astrophysical
parameters, which were then refined for the different subgroups of
CP stars. We report the *ùëá* eff and log *ùëî* for the whole sample, along
with their associated uncertainties, in Table 3: the sample of 28
stars covers, quite evenly, the *ùëá* eff range 7500‚Äì13000 K, where mainsequence A-type to late B-type objects are located, and the log *ùëî*
values are consistent with main-sequence objects. Note that the three
stars with undetermined *ùúè* (the confirmed CP2 stars KIC 2853320
and KIC 9665384 and the CP2 star candidate KIC 8362546) are the
hottest of the sample and the catalogue of Mathur et al. (2017) places
them as the farthest of the sample.
We define the amplitude of the optical variability as half the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of the smoothed

*Kepler* phase curve, while the NUV amplitude is obtained by multiplying the optical amplitude by *ùõº* . In Fig. 8, we show the plot of
the optical amplitude, the amplitude ratio *ùõº*, and the NUV amplitude
with respect to the *ùëá* eff . The Pearson‚Äôs linear correlation coefficient
*ùëü*, calculated excluding the 4 non-CP2 stars and indicated in each
panel, shows that there is no correlation between each of the amplitudes and *ùëá* eff . This result does not change significantly if we also
exclude the three stars with undetermined *ùúè* : only the correlation
between *ùëá* eff and the amplitude of the *Kepler* variability becomes
mildly positive ( *ùëü* = +0 *.* 51), while the *ùëá* eff correlation with the other
two quantities remains insignificant (| *ùëü* | *<* 0 *.* 23). The lack of significant correlation of the amplitudes also stands with log *ùëî* : in all cases
| *ùëü* | *<* 0 *.* 22. Likewise, no correlation is found with the radius and the
mass (| *ùëü* | *<* 0 *.* 23), taken from the Mathur et al. (2017) catalogue.
We also searched for correlations with stellar age. Berger et al.
(2020) determined the age of a large number of stars in the *Ke-*
*pler* prime field, collecting photometric and spectroscopic data from
several sources and the parallaxes from Gaia DR2 (e.g., Gaia Collab

From their catalogue, we acquired the age and the fraction of the
age on the main sequence for 23 stars. We computed *ùëü* for both agerelated quantities versus the *Kepler* amplitude, the NUV amplitude
and their ratio *ùõº* : in no case the value of | *ùëü* | is larger than 0.33, indicating, once again, that there is no significant correlation between
these quantities.

*5.3.1 Exploring the lack of correlation with theoretical models*

Since, as we already said, the variability of the CP2 stars depends
on the differential line blanketing on the stellar surface, the lack of
significant correlations between the amplitude of the light curves and
the investigated stellar parameters (especially *ùëá* eff ) is quite puzzling.
Aimed at understanding the reasons behind that absence of correlations, we conducted an experiment using a small library of model
atmospheres and theoretical spectral energy distributions in the *ùëá* eff
range 7000‚Äì12000 K, compatible with our target parameters. We
considered the case in which the variability is due to the presence of
a spot, with typical abundances of a CP2 star, on the surface of a star
with otherwise solar chemical composition. [8]

8 We note that the bulk chemical composition of CP2 stars is unknown and
therefore the choice of an appropriate chemical composition for theoretical
tracks remains an open question (cf. the discussion in Bagnulo et al. 2006).
However, if atomic diffusion is accepted as the main mechanism for producing
the observed chemical peculiarities, the assumption of an overall abundance
close to solar seems reasonable (cf. also H√ºmmerich et al. 2020).

The colour code is the same as in Fig. 4: the light blue symbols indicate
the confirmed CP2 stars, the dark blue symbol marks the CP2 candidate
(KIC 8362546), while the red symbols locate the non-CP2 stars. Stars with
single-wave light curves are indicated by circles, while the triangles mark
the double-wave stars (see the classification in Table 2). The three stars that
have an undetermined value of *ùúè* are identified with a yellow cross on the

anticorrelation between the *Kepler* and the *GALEX* light curves is to be
expected: cyan for single-wave light curves, red for the double-wave light
curves. Some notable objects discussed in the text are identified with their

KIC number.

We first construct a chemical composition that may represent a
‚Äògeneric CP2 star‚Äô. For this type of stars, we extracted the spectroscopic abundance of individual chemical elements, relative to the
Sun, from the catalogue of Ghazaryan et al. (2018). The total number of CP2 stars in this catalogue is 188. 71 chemical elements have
measurements, but 25 elements have no more than three values, while
six elements have more than 100 data points (O, Si, Cr, Fe, Pr, Nd).

chemical composition, we considered the abundances of Asplund
et al. (2021).
We then computed, using the Fortran code DFSYNTHE [9] by
Robert Kurucz (see, e.g., Castelli 2005), the opacity distribution
functions (ODFs; i.e. the pre-computed library of opacity for suitable intervals in temperature, pressure, and microturbulent velocity)
for the solar and for the generic CP2 chemical compositions. In
this way, we were able to quickly compute the model atmospheres
and SEDs for both chemical compositions, a fixed log *ùëî* = 4 dex
and *ùëá* eff = 7000 *,* 8000 *,* 9000 *,* 10000 *,* 11000 *,* 12000 K with Kurucz‚Äôs

mixing-length theory (MLT; B√∂hm-Vitense 1958); to treat its limited
contribution to energy transport in A-type stars, we follow the indication of Smalley (2004) to adopt the MLT parameter *ùõº* = *ùëô* / *ùêª* *ùëù* = 0 *.* 5.
The models have 72 layers and the SEDs are computed in 1221

ent, while the models at warmer *ùëá* eff have quite similar temperatures
in the optical thick regime. All the CP2 models are slightly warmer
than the corresponding solar ones in the range ‚àí2 ‚â≤ log *ùúè* Ross ‚â≤ 0,
while they become colder in the upper layers.
The low-resolution theoretical SEDs (Fig. 10) show that, with
respect to the solar reference, the CP2 models produce lower emission
in the *GALEX* NUV passband over the whole *ùëá* eff interval. This
depression is compensated by a positive excess in the optical regime
and all through the *Kepler* passband. This results imply that in our
scenario (a spot with CP2 abundances on a star with solar chemical
composition), the theoretical *GALEX* NUV and *Kepler* light curves
are anticorrelated. Furthermore, since in the NUV the flux decreases
more strongly, with decreasing *ùëá* eff, than it increases in the visible,
we expect a significant dependence on *ùëá* eff .
In order to quantify this dependence, we constructed synthetic light
curves at each *ùëá* eff . We described the time-invariant distribution of
spots with CP2 abundances by a filling factor *ùúî* ( *ùúô* ), that indicates the
fraction of the observed surface occupied by the spots and depends
on the phase *ùúô* . Therefore, the flux can be written as *ùëì* = *ùúîùëì* CP2 +(1‚àí
*ùúî* ) *ùëì* ‚äô . While the amplitude of the light curve in a single passband
depends on *ùúî* ( *ùúô* ), the amplitude ratio *ùõº* does not.
We measured *ùõº* between the synthetic NUV and the *Kepler* light
curves at all *ùëá* eff . The results confirm that *ùõº* strongly depends on *ùëá* eff :
as shown in the middle panel of Fig. 8 by the black diamonds, the
value of | *ùõº* | smoothly decreases with *ùëá* eff ; it has a maximum value
of | *ùõº* | = 4 *.* 98 at 7000 K, while it becomes lower than 1 for the two
hotter models (0.71 at 11000 K and 0.48 at 12000 K).
We note that the vast majority of the stars in our sample have
| *ùõº* | larger than the theoretical value from our experiment. This suggests that the assumed chemical compositions in our scenario are
inadequate to describe the average properties of the sample.
The experiment also shows that, at fixed abundances, there is a
clear correlation between the light curve amplitude ratios and *ùëá* eff,
while our sample shows neither a correlation with this quantity nor
with the other stellar properties that we explored. The data from
the catalogue of Ghazaryan et al. (2018) show a large dispersion
among the CP2 stars, sometimes up to four orders of magnitude,
in the abundance of individual elements. Therefore, each individual
chemical composition may be quite different from one star to the
other, and it is the dominant factor that generates the *ùõº* value, as it
determines the line blanketing in the different wavelength bands.

**6 NOTES ON SINGLE OBJECTS**

This section briefly discusses some noteworthy objects.

**6.1 The CP2 star candidates KIC 2969628, 3326428 and**

**8362546**

Initially, three candidate CP2 stars from H√ºmmerich et al. (2018)
entered our sample (KIC 2969628, 3326428 and 8362546). Two
of them, KIC 2969628 and 3326428 clearly show anticorrelation
between the NUV and visible light curves, which points to these
objects being indeed CP2 stars. At a subsequent point in our study,
we were able to confirm both objects as classical CP2 stars by our
own spectroscopic observations (cf. Section 3), which shows that the
assumptions drawn from the variability pattern have been valid.
On the other hand, the mCP star candidate KIC 8362546 does not
show any correlation between the NUV and visible light curves and
has an undetermined value of *ùúè*, which favours the scenario that this
star is not a mCP star or that the null wavelength region is located at

bluer wavelengths than the *GALEX* NUV passband. To distinguish
between the two hypotheses, spectroscopic or far-UV observations
are needed.

**6.2 The non-mCP stars KIC 5213466, 5727964, 8569986, and**

**10082844**

The four non-CP stars in our sample should not show the distinctive
anti-correlation between the NUV and visible light curves as ACV
variables do. In agreement with this expectation, the non-CP star
KIC 5213466 (spectral type A1 V; H√ºmmerich et al. 2018) shows
a strong positive correlation between both wavelength bands. It is,
however, one of the stars with the minimum number of GALEX
observations. Nevertheless, this finding corroborates the result of
H√ºmmerich et al. (2018) that this star is not an ACV star. Its *Kepler*
light curve shows large variations in amplitude and shape which
are not expected in this type of variables. This is also true for the
non-CP stars KIC 5727964 (A6 V; H√ºmmerich et al. 2018) and
KIC 10082844 (A0 V; H√ºmmerich et al. 2018), which, in agreement
with this, do not show any significant correlation between the NUV
and visible light curves. However, the amplitudes of the variability
are small in both objects and the NUV errors quite large. Lastly,
the non-CP star KIC 8569986 (A2 V; H√ºmmerich et al. 2018) has
a significant Pearson‚Äôs *ùëü* = ‚àí0 *.* 68; nevertheless, the low number
of the *GALEX* points, their dispersion and a large phase gap in its
phase diagram (see Appendix A) cast doubts on the real presence of
an anticorrelation. A campaign of simultaneous photometric visible
and ultraviolet (preferably in the far-UV) observations and/or highresolution spectra of this star would be needed to clarify the nature
of this star.

**7 CONCLUSIONS**

Based on observational data from the GALEX and *Kepler* prime
missions, we carried out a study of the properties of the photometric
variability of a sample of 22 spectroscopically confirmed CP2 stars,
one photometrically confirmed mCP star (KIC 7976845), one mCP
star candidate (KIC 8362546), and four non-CP stars (KIC 5213466,
5727964, 8569986, 10082844) in the NUV and visible wavelength

regions. To date, this is the largest sample of mCP stars studied in
the NUV wavelength region. We furthermore investigated the presence of a correlation of the variability amplitudes in both wavelength
regions with stellar parameters such as effective temperature and surface gravity. To connect our findings to theoretical considerations, we
calculated model atmospheres, spectral energy distribution profiles
and synthetic light curves.
The main findings are summarised in the following:

 - We observe antiphase variations between the NUV and optical
light curves in the majority of mCP stars. This indicates that the
presence of this particular variability pattern is common also in the
NUV wavelength interval and not only at FUV wavelengths. It also
means that the combination of NUV and visible observations are

suitable for identifying mCP star candidates.

 - While the theoretical calculations show that, at fixed abundances, a clear correlation between the light curve amplitude ratios
and *ùëá* eff is expected, our sample does not show a correlation with
any of the investigated properties. This may be due to the highly
individualistic abundance patterns of CP2 stars, which are the main
contributors to the line blanketing in different wavelength bands.

### UV survey of mCP stars in Kepler field 15

**Figure A1.** Phase diagrams for the stars of our sample. Orange dots are the *ùúé* -clipped *Kepler* data, while the smoothed curve is shown in red. The blue curve is
the best fit of the *GALEX* points (large blue dots), obtained from the genetic algorithm, as explained in Sect. 4.1. On top of each panel, the KIC ID and some of
the results of Table 2 are reported.
